This is a Hotel reservation system which makes use of PHP / MySQL / AJAX and Bootstrap.

A customer would enter their details into the form which has some basic validation and
also a customer cant have the same e-mail address or check-in date as another.

Once submitted the details are saved to an mySQL database created using PHPmyAdmin.

Another page which acts as an 'admin' side, allows you to view all information of the
customers that have booked in and using ajax, you can live search the database for a
specific customer's information.

It is a basic PHP site but it gets the job done.

You can download all the files and locally host them using xampp.
